      "description": "We understand that organizations are facing the following challenges (3 axes):\n\nGenerating Digital Experiences is not enough, it is necessary to completely digitize the way we generate value, with accelerated development times, short cycles and continuous feedback, allowing the sustainable evolution of products.\n\nCompanies and startups need robustness and availability, beyond preventing outages, degradations or failures, a quick response to incidents is necessary.\n\nEntrepreneurship culture, incorporating technologies, methodologies and tools supported by technological architecture to achieve innovation together with evolution based on data science.\n\nSoftware Architecture becomes a core discipline to take charge of any project that proposes to solve complex problems through a technological solution and make it sustainable over time.\n\nFrom GoElevate, having trained more than 1000 Architects across the region, we have created a training based on industry best practices.\n\nWe want to provide these initial capabilities to future Software Architects as well as solidify the techniques of those who already practice them by giving them a methodological framework considering the current technological trends.",
